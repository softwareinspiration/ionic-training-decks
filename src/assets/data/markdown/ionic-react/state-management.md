# Lab: State Management

In this lab, you will learn how to:

- Use the React Context API for global state management
- Redirect unauthenticated users away from protected routes
-

## Overview

In the last lab we wrote functionality that supports our authentication data service, providing outlets to sign in, to sign out, and to determine if the current application user is already authenticated. In order to bring this functionality to the components that our application is comprised of, we're going to make use of state management. This way, our components can listen for changes to state and act accordingly.

There are several third party state management libraries available (such as Redux and MobX) but we can make use of React Hooks to easily build this functionality out.

## Authentication Context

The <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" target="_blank">React Context API</a> provides a way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through each level of the component tree. This allows us to create a "global" state object that any portion of our application can obtain and listen to changes on.
