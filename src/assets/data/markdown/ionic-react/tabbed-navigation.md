# Lab: Add Application Tabs

In this lab you will:

- Scaffold additional application pages
- Create a tabbed navigation component and add it to your application
- Rework the routing so the pages draw in the router outlet for the tabs

This application will have a small number of distinct pages, so tabbed navigation makes the most sense.
