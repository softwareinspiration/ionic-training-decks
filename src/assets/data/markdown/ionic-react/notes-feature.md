# Lab: Add the Notes Feature

In this lab you will:

- Take what you have learned so far and add a whole new feature
- Use some Ionic Framework components we have not seen yet, including:
- The modal overlay, various form elements, and the sliding Ion Item

## Overview

Before we move onto new stuff, there are a couple of preliminary items that we need to get out of the way first:

- Create a data model
- Create a data service singleton that performs HTTP requests

These are a couple things we have done multiple times now, so I will just give you the code to move things along. If you are still unsure on these items though, please review the code that is provided here.

## Conclusion

Congratulations. You have used what we have learned to this point to add a whole new feature to your app. Along the way, you also exercised a few Framework components you had not used before. We are almost done with this app. One more page to go and we will be done.
